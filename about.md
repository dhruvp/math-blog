Hi! I'm Dhruv Parthasarathy and I currently work at [Athelas](https://athelas.com) where we use machine learning to bring point of care diagnostics to patients. I'm passionate about using technology and education to provide people the opportunity to live the life they wish to lead. I graduated from MIT with double major in Math and CS in 2013.
